Description: ErlangMS
 ErlangMS is a platform developed in Erlang/OTP to facilitate the integration of systems through a service-oriented 
 approach for the systems of the University of Brazilia. This work is the result of efforts made in the Master of
  Applied Computing at the University of Brasilia by graduate student Everton Vargas Agilar.
  .
 The platform consists of a Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), called EmsBus, and a documented architecture to 
 implement the services in Erlang, Java and future in .NET Framework languages.
